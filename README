NAME
    XML::XPath::Simple - Very simple interface for XPaths

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::XPath::Simple;
  
      $xp = new XML::XPath::Simple(
                                   xml => $xml,
                                   context => '/'
                                   );
      $content = $xp->valueof('/doc/c[2]/d[1]@id');

DESCRIPTION
    XML::XPath::Simple is designed to allow for the use of simple
    Abbreviated XPath syntax to access values from a small XML document.
    This module is not meant as a drop-in replacement for XML::XPath, and
    doesn't support the entire W3C XPath Recommendation. This module is
    meant as an easy and simple way to access XML data from small,
    non-complex structures.

    XML::XPath::Simple doesn't support documents that have elements
    containing mixed content (text and tags), nor does it allow for the
    walking of the tree structure, or the counting of elements. While this
    module allows access to specific nodes using the position() function,
    internally the module doesn't necessarially parse the XML structure in
    any specific order, so position() calls may not return the value
    expected.

METHODS
  Creation

      $xp = new XML::XPath::Simple(
                           			xml => $xml,
                                    context => '/'
                                    );

    new Creates a new XML::XPath::Simple object. The constructor requires an
    XML document be passed to it as text using the xml option. An optional
    default context may be set using context but if no context is specified
    it is set to '/'(root).

  context()

      $xp->context('/doc/a');
      $mycont = $xp->context();

    context allows for the retrieval of the currently set context as an
    XPath expression, or for setting a new default context.

  find()

      $xp->find('/doc/a');

    find looks for the node specified by the XPath expression provided. This
    method returns true if the node exists, and false otherwise.

  valueof()

      $myval = $xp->valueof('/doc/a');

    valueof returns the value stored in the node specified by the XPath
    expression provided.

DIAGNOSTICS
    XML::XPath::Simple -- No XML to parse: This module requires an XML
    string.
        (F) The module was not provided an XML document to parse.
